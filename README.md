Yeah, I have too many subtitles for this one. Oh well! Welcome!

This repo contains the materials for my talk about the ways that Airflow and Redshift can be used to make machine learning pipelines work. 
To prepare for watching this talk, you don't need to install anything, it's purely instructional, not a hands on workshop. However, if you want to get a leg up, you can mess around with Airflow for free because it is an open source tool.

* Installation instructions: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/start.html

Redshift, of course, is not free and I don't want anyone to think you need to go out and spend money on this on my account. You can get by fine with a local postgres installation if you really want to try the database side stuff. It is a fine data storage option and in fact shares a common ancestor with Redshift.

* Get started with PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/ and https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial.html

Someday in the future if there is interest I may create a hands on tutorial version of this talk that does use postgres. If you would want this, let me know!
