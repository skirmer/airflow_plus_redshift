Yeah, I have too many subtitles for this one. Oh well! Welcome!

This repo contains the materials for my upcoming ODSC Europe 2020 talk. Please join me on September 19 at 2:55 PM BST (GMT +1) to see the presentation live and ask your own questions. Or, you can tweet at me @data_stephanie to ask ahead of time.

To prepare for this talk, you don't need to install anything, it's purely instructional, not a hands on workshop. However, if you want to get a leg up, you can mess around with Airflow for free because it is an open source tool.

* Installation instructions: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/start.html

Redshift, of course, is not free and I don't want anyone to think you need to go out and spend money on this on my account. You can get by fine with a local postgres installation if you really want to try the database side stuff. It is a fine data storage option and in fact shares a common ancestor with Redshift.

* Get started with PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/ and https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial.html

Someday in the future if there is interest I may create a hands on tutorial version of this talk that does use postgres. If you would want this, let me know!
